8-Bit Compiler
===

This is a project to write a compiler for Ben Eater's 8-bit computer.

The computer used in this compiler has a few modifications to Eaters.

- It has a jump equal to zero and jump less than zero instruction
- It has 8 bit instruction data
- It has an 8 bit memory address register
